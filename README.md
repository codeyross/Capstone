Only Nans

Only Nans is an app designed to highlight female identifying chefs and help them make money for their home recipes.
Some of us are lucky enough to have Nan's who are incredible cooks. Some of us are not.
Now you can learn to cook from the most talented Nans in the world that traditionally only share recipes with family.
Users will be able to access creators' content once a subscription is paid.
Chefs can offer a variety of content from recipes to pictures and videos as well as set the price for their subscriptions and content.
